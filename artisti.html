        <h3>Icinori</h3>
        <div class="cont">
        <p>Mayumi Otero and Raphael Urwiller’s prolific outpouring of work makes a very good case for living somewhere as they do in a quiet suburb just outside of Paris. They met as art students in Strasbourg a decade ago and now spend their days drawing, writing, painting, publishing, collecting, and, in their words, <span style="color:#e22c2c">“expanding their inner universe”</span>.</p>
        <p>Their work is a breathlessly wonderful, modern folkloric study of scenes and characters that are at once of our world and from another galaxy altogether. Together, they love solving problems, getting lost in research, coming up with ideas, experimenting with new working methods, and, most importantly, finding joy and happiness from the result. </p>
        <p><span style="color:#e22c2c">“Always be on the move, intellectually and spatially”</span>, they say. <span style="color:#e22c2c">“In a rare and exceptional moment, something incredible appears in a drawing; it’s pure magic, and it is precious and extraordinary. Most of our work is looking for those moments of grace”</span>. Which is something we predict happens rather regularly.</p>

        <h3>Hattie Clark</h3>
        <div class="cont">
        <p>Hattie Clark's illustrations are a pure reflection of her character - friendly, kind & enthusiastic. She draws the kind of folks you want to sit down and have a cup of tea with.</p>
        <p>Based in Leeds (UK), Hattie has perfected her self-proclaimed 'wobbly' illustration style and loves to draw a wide variety of subjects, including people, animals and buildings.</p>
        <p>She can work both digitally or by hand, using brush & ink (see if you can spot which is which). This also makes her work perfect for animation, as you can see throughout her portfolio.</p>
        <p>Some of the people Hattie has worked with so far include: Stagecoach, Stack Magazines, Pieminister, Lucy and Yak, The Charity for Civil Servants, Bath Spa University, House of Fu, Leeds Bid. We predict that's a list which will grow and grow!</p>

        <h3>Paul Blow</h3>
        <div class="cont">
        <p>Take a minute to lose yourself in the illustrated world of Paul Blow, you won't be sorry. At first he draws you in with a beautiful or eye catching image, but often there's much more to it than that. He's also telling you a story (or a joke) through his sublime work. A wickedly dry sense of humour runs through many of his best known images.</p>
        <p>From the conceptual to the absurd, his versatile range sees him navigate seamlessly from high brow, to low and exist everywhere in between. From Jackass to the Washington Post, Doordash to Harvard, Paul's talents have seen him work a hugely diverse client list across the worlds of editorial, publishing and advertising.</p>
        <p>Notable clients include Nike, The New York Times, Penguin Books and the Folio Society.</p>

        <p>There is an inherent joy in the sweet, ink and water colour work of Glasgow School of Art graduate, Emily Robertson.</p>

        <p>From juicy pastries and cosmetics to maps and stylish portraits of butchers, Emily’s eye for colour and texture is remarkable, and very popular among her clients, including: Anthropologie, Chanel, Faber&Faber, Marks and Spencer, National Trust, Pentagram NY and Port magazine.</p>

            <p>Berlin-based illustrator Martina Paukova likes to dabble in the colorful nuances of everyday moments. <span style="color:#e22c2c">“My work consists of daily mundane scenes and lanky characters, often with perplexed expressions and dated hairdos, sitting behind computers or sipping coffee”</span>, she says. <span style="color:#e22c2c">“I like to explore and mold the everyday, the awkward, and the bendy”</span>.</p>
            <p>Martina’s work has rocketed in popularity in the last couple of years, seeing her create humorous, jam-packed images in a trademark palette with Memphis-inspired patterns for an increasingly impressive list of clients. Previously, Martina studied politics in Slovakia before changing direction to study illustration at Camberwell College of Arts in London.</p>
            <p>She now spends her days on various editorial and commercial commissions, injecting personality into an image in a way that is uniquely her own. Like a modern-day MC Escher, her colorful, quirky perspectives move and change, with each element slotting together like a well-crafted puzzle.</p>

            <p>In 2006, she won Cannes Young Creatives and was awarded Junior of The Year in 2007 at the Finnish Best of the Year advertising and design competition.</p>
            <p>Inspired by the luscious flora and fauna surrounding her in her native Finland, Sanna’s images are mixed media odes to the unpredictable, cluttered joys of the world around her.</p>
